This is a [Redis](https://redis.io/) starter template for Go:

- [Redis Cloud](https://redis.io/try-free/)
- [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/)

## Requirements

- [make](https://www.make.com/en)
- [go>=1.22](https://go.dev/)
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
   - Optional

## Getting started

Copy and edit the `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Your `.env` file should contain the connection string you copied from Redis Cloud.

Your `.env.docker` file will look similar to `.env`, but should use the appropriate docker internal URLs. Here is
an example:

```bash
REDIS_URL="redis://redis:6379"
```

Next, spin up docker containers:

```bash
make docker
```

or

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

You should have a server running on `http://localhost:<port>` where the port is set in your `.env` file (default is 8000). You can test the following routes:

1. `GET /api/todos` - Gets all todos
2. `GET /api/todos/:id` - Gets a todo by ID
3. `GET /api/todos?[name=<name>]&[status=<status>]` - Search for todos by name and/or status
4. `POST /api/todos` - Create a todo with `{ "name": "Sample todo" }`
5. `PATCH /api/todos/:id` - Update todo by ID with `{ "status": "todo|in progress|complete" }`
6. `DELETE /api/todos/:id` - Delete a todo by ID

## Running tests

There are some tests in the `pkg/todos/store_test.go` file that can be run with the following command:

```bash
make test
```

```bash
go mod tidy && go test pkg/todos/store_test.go pkg/todos/store.go -v
```

These tests setup and teardown on their own. You can modify them if you want to leave data in Redis.

## Running locally outside docker

To run the development server outside of docker:

```bash
make dev
```

or

```bash
go mod tidy && go run cmd/main.go
```

## Other Scripts

Building a binary:

```bash
make
```

or

```bash
go mod tidy && go build -o ./bin/app cmd/main.go
```

## Connecting to Redis Cloud

If you don't yet have a database setup in Redis Cloud [get started here for free](https://redis.io/try-free/).

To connect to a Redis Cloud database, log into the console and find the following:

1. The `public endpoint` (looks like `redis-#####.c###.us-east-1-#.ec2.redns.redis-cloud.com:#####`)
1. Your `username` (`default` is the default username, otherwise find the one you setup)
1. Your `password` (either setup through Data Access Control, or available in the `Security` section of the database
   page.

Combine the above values into a connection string and put it in your `.env` and `.env.docker` accordingly. It should
look something like the following:

```bash
REDIS_URL="redis://default:<password>@redis-#####.c###.us-west-2-#.ec2.redns.redis-cloud.com:#####"
```

Run the [tests](#running-tests) to verify that you are connected properly.
